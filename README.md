This repository contains tutorials for various Python libraries. Each tutorial is designed to help you learn and understand different Python libraries and their functionalities.

## Numpy Tutorials

Numpy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides powerful tools for working with arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions. The following tutorials are available:

1. [Introduction to Numpy](tutorials/numpy/introduction.md): Learn the basics of Numpy, including array creation, indexing, and basic operations.

2. [Array Manipulation](tutorials/numpy/array_manipulation.md): Explore various techniques for manipulating arrays, such as reshaping, stacking, and splitting.

3. [Array Broadcasting](tutorials/numpy/array_broadcasting.md): Understand the concept of broadcasting in Numpy and how it allows for element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes.

4. [Array Indexing and Slicing](tutorials/numpy/array_indexing_slicing.md): Learn how to access and manipulate specific elements or subarrays within Numpy arrays.

5. [Linear Algebra with Numpy](tutorials/numpy/linear_algebra.md): Dive into linear algebra operations using Numpy, including matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.

6. [Random Number Generation](tutorials/numpy/random_number_generation.md): Explore Numpy's random module and learn how to generate random numbers and arrays.

7. [File Input and Output](tutorials/numpy/file_io.md): Discover different methods to read data from files and save Numpy arrays to files.
